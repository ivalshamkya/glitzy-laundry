# Laundry Web Application
Welcome to the Laundry Web Application project! This PHP-based web application helps manage laundry services.

## Background

This project was created while I was learning PHP. As a beginner in PHP programming, I wanted to explore web development and create a simple application to understand the fundamentals better. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in building web applications, implementing user authentication, and managing database interactions using PHP native.

While the code may not be perfect and there is always room for improvement, it represents my initial journey into the world of PHP programming. I hope that this project can serve as a learning resource for other beginners looking to explore PHP and web development.

Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, or contribute to the project! Your feedback and contributions are highly appreciated.
